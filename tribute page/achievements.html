        <p><h3> 1. HE HELPED BUILD INDIA’S FIRST INDIGENOUS HOVERCRAFT</h3><br>
          Abdul Kalam joined the Aeronautical Development Establishment of the Defense Research and Development Organization (DRDO),
         right after graduating from the Madras Institute of Technology in 1960. As a young scientist, he was assigned his 
         first project to design and develop a hovercraft for the country’s defence applications. A hovercraft is an
          amphibious craft capable of travelling over land, water, mud, ice and other surfaces. After days of hard-work,
           Kalam and his team were successful in developing India’s first indigenous hovercraft which was named Nandi, 
           the impressive white bull who acts as the vehicle of the Hindu deity Lord Shiva. Project Nandi received massive 
           applause from the then Defense Minister, V.K Krishna Menon, and encouraged Kalam for his future endeavours.
            However, Project Nandi was shelved as the new government in power didn’t show any interest in the invention.</p><br>

              <h3> 2. HE WAS PART OF THE TEAM WHICH SET UP TERLS  </h3><br>
              <p>
                Though Project Nandi was put in cold storage, due to it Kalam got a call from the Indian Committee for Space 
                Research (INCOSPAR) to attend an interview at the Tata Institute of Fundamental Research (TIFR). At the time,
                 INCOSPAR was formed out of the TIFR talent pool. Among the members of the selection panel who interviewed
                  Kalam was Dr. Vikram Sarabhai, the father of the Indian Space Programme and the founder of
                   Indian Space Research Organisation (ISRO). Dr. Sarabhai took a deep interest in Kalam and 
                   selected him as a rocket engineer in INCOSPAR. The team of rocket engineers of which Kalam was a part,
                    set up the Thumba Equatorial Rocket Launching Station (TERLS) in 1963. TERLS is used by ISRO to launch sounding rockets even today.

              <h3> 3. KALAM WAS THE PROJECT DIRECTOR OF INDIA’S FIRST SLV</h3><br>
              <p>In 1969, when INCOSPAR led to the birth of the ISRO, Kalam was transferred there and was initially involved in research about building rockets. 
                In the early 1970s, ISRO introduced its own Satellite Launch Vehicle program owing to geopolitical and economic considerations. It was a program
                to develop the technology needed to launch satellites. Dr. A. P. J. Abdul Kalam was made the project director of the program. Beginning with
                mechanical designing to electrical integration, Kalam single-handedly supervised every aspect of the project, which was a massive success.
                On July 18, 1980, Satellite Launch Vehicle-3 (SLV-3) was successfully launched from Sriharikota range in the Nellore district of Andhra Pradesh.
                It deployed the Rohini satellite in near-earth orbit. It was the first successful satellite launch that took place on Indian soil and thereby made
                India the seventh member of an exclusive club of space-faring nations in international society.</p><br>

                <h3>4. HE WAS RESPONSIBLE FOR THE SUCCESSFUL LAUNCH OF AGNI AND PRITHVI MISSILES</h3><br>
                <p>After the huge triumph of SLV-III and dedicating the paramount years of his life to ISRO, Dr. Kalam was issued transfer orders to DRDO,
                   where he was given the responsibility to lead the Integrated Guided Missile Development Program (IGMDP). According to the instructions
                   of then Defence Minister R. Venkataraman, four missiles were to be developed simultaneously as part of the program. After years of consistent
                   hard work and immense dedication, India got her first range of ballistic missiles, the Prithvi, the Agni, the Aakash, and the Nag.
                   Out of the four, two missiles, namely, Prithvi, the tactical surface-to-surface missile; and Agni, an intermediate-range ballistic missile;
                   were launched successfully. Due to this mammoth achievement under his leadership, India became a major military power and Dr Kalam became
                   popularly known as the “Missile Man of India”.</p><br>

              <h3>5. DR KALAM SUPERVISED THE POKHRAN-II EXPLOSIONS AS THE CHIEF OF DRDO</h3><br>
              <p>Dr. A. P. J. Abdul Kalam served as the Chief Scientific Adviser to the Prime Minister and Secretary of the Defence Research and Development 
                Organisation (DRDO) from July 1992 to December 1999. The Pokhran-II nuclear tests were conducted during this period and Kalam played an intensive 
                political and technological role in their success. Along with Dr. R. Chidambaram, the Director of the Department of Atomic Energy (DAE), 
                he served as the chief coordinator in the planning of the tests. The Pokhran-II tests, a series of five nuclear bomb test explosions, 
                were conducted at the Indian Army’s Pokhran Test Range in May 1998. The tests achieved their main objective of giving India the capability
                 to build fission and thermonuclear weapons with yields up to 200 Kilotons. Exclusive media coverage during the event,
                  made Kalam a household name in India and he became the best known nuclear scientist in the nation.</p><br>

              <h3>6. HE SERVED AS THE FIRST PRINCIPAL SCIENTIFIC ADVISOR TO THE GOVERNMENT OF INDIA</h3><br>
              <p>After his retirement from DRDO, Kalam was appointed as the first-ever Principal Scientific Advisor (PSA) to the Government Of India from November
                 1999 to November 2001. Principal Scientific Advisor was a Cabinet rank position at the time and was largely created to assist scientific
                cross-sectoral synergy across ministries, institutions and the industry. During his service period, Dr. Kalam supervised committees making
                 master plans regarding defence, agriculture, healthcare and information technology. Under this esteemed post, he was also responsible for
                 evolving policies, strategies and missions for many developmental applications.</p><br>

               <h3>7. DR. A. P. J. ABDUL KALAM SERVED AS THE 11TH PRESIDENT OF INDIA</h3><br>
               <p>On June 10, 2002, the National Democratic Alliance (NDA), the then ruling party expressed their will to nominate Dr. Kalam for the post of President.
                  On June 18, Kalam filed his nomination papers in the Indian Parliament. He went on to win the 2002 Indian presidential election with an electoral 
                  vote of 922,884 as compared to 107,366 votes won by Lakshmi Sahgal. Kalam was the first scientist to become the president of India.
                  During his term as president, he was fondly called the People’s President because of his humility, integrity, vision; and his immense
                  contribution to inspire and nurture the young minds of the nation. Dr. Kalam’s guidelines under the scheme of “Vision of 2020” 
                  to make India a developed country has been incorporated under plans of the Indian Government. After the expiry of his term and
                  his unwillingness to contest the election for the second term, Pratibha Patil became his successor as the 12th president
                  of India. Dr. A. P. J. Abdul Kalam served as the 11th President of India from July 25, 2002 to July 25, 2007.</p><br>
